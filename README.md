# LaserGame
My own version of a 2.5D Laser Game.

The goal of the game is for the user to guide a laser to its target.

## Scenes
TestLevel shows the available mirrors and how the source/target work.

Level one is easy. Level two as well, riiight? ;)

## Future work
The current focus of the work is to build a big bunch of functional levels, the prettification will occur later :)
